Ever wished you could upload and manage documents in the cloud without a headache?
I built Control-Hub â€” a simple, secure, and subscription-based document manager.

ğŸ’¡ What you get:
âœ… Upload 2 free documents â€” no strings attached
ğŸš€ Go Pro (monthly/yearly) for unlimited uploads
ğŸ”’ Secure cloud storage powered by Supabase
ğŸ’³ Smooth subscription handling with Stripe

ğŸ›  Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, Supabase, Stripe, and a bunch of other cool tools.
